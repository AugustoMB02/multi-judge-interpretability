# **Robust Multi-Judge Aggregation: From Theory to Practice**

## **TL;DR**

We propose systematic experiments to transform our multi-judge aggregation system from a proof-of-concept into a robust, validated framework. Through controlled robustness testing, improved ground truth validation, and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods like Mixture of Judges (MoJ), we aim to understand when and how learned judge aggregation provides safety and performance benefits over naive approaches.

## **Core Research Questions**

1. **How robust is learned aggregation to adversarial inputs?** (contaminated judges, troll personas)  
2. **What ground truth best validates multi-judge systems?** (synthetic vs. real human preferences)  
3. **How does our approach compare to existing methods?** (MoJ, single powerful judges)  
4. **What makes judges effective or ineffective?** (interpretability, bias analysis)

## **Proposed Experiments**

### **Track 1: Robustness Analysis**

**Timeline: Week 1-2**

#### **Experiment 1A: Judge Contamination**

* **Setup**: Introduce deliberately flawed judges (inverted metrics, random noise, safety-blind rubrics)  
* **Method**: Train aggregator with contaminated judge(s) among normal ones  
* **Metrics**: Performance degradation vs. naive averaging, learned weight inspection  
* **Expected Result**: Learned aggregator assigns near-zero or negative weights to bad judges, maintaining \<10% performance loss vs 20-30% for naive methods

#### **Experiment 1B: Persona Poisoning**

* **Setup**: Include "troll" personas in training data that systematically misrate responses  
* **Method**: Vary contamination rates (5%, 10%, 25% bad personas)  
* **Metrics**: RÂ² on clean test set, preference conflict detection  
* **Expected Result**: Identify contamination threshold where aggregator fails, develop detection methods

#### **Experiment 1C: Rubric Sensitivity**

* **Setup**: Create semantically equivalent but differently phrased rubrics  
* **Method**: Test same content with varied prompting styles, definitions  
* **Metrics**: Score variance, cross-rubric correlation  
* **Expected Result**: Robust aggregator shows \<5% variance across equivalent rubrics

### **Track 2: Ground Truth Validation**

**Timeline: Week 1-2 (parallel)**

#### **Experiment 2A: UltraFeedback Integration**

* **Setup**: Use UltraFeedback's 5-objective ratings (Instruction Following, Truthfulness, etc.)  
* **Method**: Treat one dimension (overall score) as ground truth, others as simulated judge's score. See how our aggregator does.  
* **Metrics**: Prediction accuracy, dimension importance analysis  
* **Expected Result**: Match or exceed GPT-4 single-judge baseline

### **Track 3: Architectural Comparisons**

**Timeline: Week 2**

#### **Experiment 3A: Mixture of Judges (MoJ) Benchmark**

* **Setup**: Implement MoJ's context-aware gating vs our fixed aggregator  
* **Method**: Compare in RLHF simulation and response ranking tasks  
* **Metrics**: Performance, computational cost, interpretability  
* **Expected Result**: Our method provides 80% of MoJ performance at 10% computational cost

#### **Experiment 3B: Judge Self-Bias Analysis**

* **Setup**: Test if judge LLMs favor responses from same model family  
* **Method**: Cross-evaluate responses from different LLMs  
* **Metrics**: Bias matrix, model-agnostic vs model-dependent scoring  
* **Expected Result**: Quantify self-preference bias, develop correction methods

### **Track 4: Interpretability Deep Dive**

**Timeline: Week 2**

#### **Experiment 4A: Learned Function Analysis**

* **Setup**: Systematic interpretability of GAM and MLP aggregators  
* **Method**: Partial dependence plots, feature importance, activation patching  
* **Metrics**: Judge contribution patterns, interaction effects  
* **Expected Result**: Identify "veto" judges, synergistic pairs, redundant metrics

#### **Experiment 4B: Sparse Additive Distillation**

* **Setup**: Train minimal GAM to mimic MLP behavior  
* **Method**: Progressive feature addition, interaction surface mapping  
* **Metrics**: Approximation quality vs model complexity  
* **Expected Result**: 90% variance explained with 3-5 key features

## **Expected Contributions**

1. **Robustness Guarantees**: Quantified tolerance to adversarial judges/personas  
2. **Validation Framework**: Best practices for ground truth in multi-judge systems  
3. **Efficiency Results**: Learned aggregation vs. complex alternatives (MoJ)  
4. **Interpretability Tools**: Methods to understand and debug judge combinations  
5. **Open Dataset**: Contaminated judge/persona test suite for future research

## **Implementation Plan**

**Week 1, Days 1-3**:

* Set up parallel pipelines for Tracks 1 & 2  
* Begin judge contamination and UltraFeedback integration

**Week 1, Days 4-7**:

* Complete initial robustness experiments  
* Start persona poisoning tests  
* Initial ground truth comparison

**Week 2, Days 1-3**:

* MoJ implementation and benchmarking  
* Begin interpretability analysis  
* Judge self-bias testing

**Week 2, Days 4-7**:

* Complete all experiments  
* Synthesis and writeup  
* Prepare visualizations and demos

## **Risk Mitigation**

* **Compute limitations**: Prioritize smaller-scale robustness tests first  
* **Data access issues**: Have synthetic backup for UltraFeedback  
* **Time constraints**: Core robustness experiments (1A, 1B) are minimum viable  
* **Negative results**: Even "failure" provides valuable safety insights

## **Success Metrics**

* At least 2x robustness improvement over naive averaging  
* Successful detection of 90% of contaminated judges  
* Interpretable aggregation rules from learned models  
* Reproducible benchmark against MoJ or similar SOTA
