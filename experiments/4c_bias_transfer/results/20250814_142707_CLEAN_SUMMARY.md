# Experiment 4C: Framing Effects and Bias Transfer - Clean Results

## Experiment Overview
- **Run Date**: 2025-08-14T14:27:07
- **Mode**: Full
- **Judge Scoring**: Real
- **Score Normalization**: Disabled

## Dataset Summary
- **Total Tokens Analyzed**: 3,409
- **Positive Sentiment**: 1176
- **Negative Sentiment**: 2204
- **Neutral Control**: 27
- **Total Score Records**: 20

## Model Analysis
- **Individual Judges**: 10
- **Aggregation Methods**: Naive Average + MLP Aggregator

## Bias Reduction Results

### Framing Bias
- **Individual Judge Mean**: 0.537
- **Naive Average**: 0.057 (89.4% reduction)
- **MLP Aggregator**: 0.401 (25.2% reduction)

### Frequency Bias
- **Individual Judge Mean**: 0.240
- **Naive Average**: 0.026 (89.1% reduction)
- **MLP Aggregator**: 0.275 (-14.9% reduction)

## Key Findings

- MLP reduces framing bias by 25.2%
- MLP increases frequency bias by 14.9%
- Naive averaging reduces framing bias by 89.4%
- Naive averaging reduces frequency bias by 89.1%
- Naive averaging outperforms MLP on framing bias
- Naive averaging outperforms MLP on frequency bias

- **Bias Reduction Plots**: `20250814_142707_bias_reduction_plots.png`

## Interpretation
The bias reduction percentages show how much each aggregation method reduces the cognitive biases present in individual judges:
- **Positive values** = Bias reduction (desirable)
- **Negative values** = Bias amplification (concerning)
- **Comparison**: MLP vs Naive averaging performance
